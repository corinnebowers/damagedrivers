This repository provides data, code, and supplementary information associated with the paper "Uncovering Effects of Exposure and Vulnerability on Atmospheric River Flood Damage using Interpretable Machine Learning" (doi:XX). The `_data` folder contains code to collect all of the hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and damage data used to generate the random forest models. The `_scripts` folder contains code to train and evaluate the random forest models, as well as code to calculate the SHAP values and ALE curves. The `_results` folder contains code and formatted markdown files that reproduce all figures and numerical results from the papers. The markdown files are also available as interactive HTML documents through the links below. 

* [reproduce_figures_sequences.html](https://corinnebowers.github.io/reproduce_figures.html) replicates all figures and numerical results from the main body of the paper.
